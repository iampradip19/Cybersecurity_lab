# Penetration Testing Steps

## Step 1: Find Information
First, gather as much information as you can about the target system (e.g., websites, IP addresses).

## Step 2: Scan for Vulnerabilities
Use tools like **Nmap** to look for weaknesses in the system.

## Step 3: Test the Vulnerabilities
Try to exploit the weaknesses you found (this is the real test).

## Step 4: Report
Write a report explaining what you found and how to fix it.
